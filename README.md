# Project "Karty Podskazhut"
https://annabreamer.github.io/karty-podskazhut/
## Overview
This project showcases a responsive web page that adapts to user preferences for device size and theme. I built the page using advanced CSS techniques—including CSS variables, pseudo-elements, and responsive units—to implement both light and dark themes. The design features custom typography, dynamic layouts for headings, paragraphs, quotes, lists, and images, as well as detailed styling such as drop caps and tooltips.

## Technologies Used
**HTML5, CSS3** (responsive design, CSS variables, pseudo-elements)**, Git, Figma**
